# Clinic

Simple web application for academic project. 
It allows making reservations to appointments with choosen doctors, on choosen date, browsing your planned visits,
cancelling them. It's made using Vaadin - did it in a hurry so no good practises involved ...
It uses Okta framework for authentication. Some screens below.
